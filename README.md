# EC7212 â€“ Computer Vision and Image Processing: Take Home Assignment 2

## File Structure

- `Q1.py`: Otsu's algorithm with Gaussian noise
- `Q2.py`: Region growing segmentation
- `images/`: Output images/results

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
   ```

2. Run Otsu's thresholding:
   ```
   python Q1.py
   ```

3. Run region growing:
   ```
   python Q2.py
   ```

4. Check the `images/` folder for results.
